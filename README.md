The TV show search app is a web application that allows users to search for their favorite TV shows and retrieve information about them. This app is built using HTML and JavaScript as its tech stack, making it lightweight and easily accessible to users across a variety of devices.

The app uses Axios to send a request to the TVMaze API, which is a comprehensive database of TV shows and related information. This API allows the app to retrieve data about shows, including their title, description, cast, and ratings, among other things.

To use the app, users simply need to enter the name of the show they want to search for into the search bar. The app then sends a request to the TVMaze API using Axios and retrieves the relevant information about the show. The information is then displayed to the user in an easy-to-read format, allowing them to quickly and easily learn more about the show they are interested in.

One of the key features of the app is its simplicity and ease of use. The app has been designed to be intuitive and easy to navigate, making it accessible to users of all skill levels. The search bar is prominently displayed on the homepage, and users can quickly and easily enter the name of the show they want to search for.

Another important feature of the app is its ability to provide users with detailed information about the shows they are interested in. The app uses the TVMaze API to retrieve a wealth of information about each show, including its plot summary, cast list, and episode information. This information is presented in a clear and concise format, making it easy for users to find the information they need.

Overall, the TV show search app is a powerful and user-friendly tool for anyone who loves TV shows and wants to learn more about them. Its use of HTML and JavaScript as its tech stack makes it accessible to users across a variety of devices, and its integration with the TVMaze API ensures that users have access to the most up-to-date and accurate information about their favorite show
